Microsoft provides a pretty nice API for communicating with their Xbox360 DevKits. The only problem is that it's closed source and it's only compiled for windows. So anyways, I decided to rewrite the library so that OS X and Linux users can communicate with there kits. A lot of cool stuff could be done with this. When it's finished someone could create a cross-platform debugger, or something like Neighborhood.
